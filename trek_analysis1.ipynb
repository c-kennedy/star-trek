    "As a longtime Trekkie, it seemed like a neat idea to use the corpus of *Star Trek* scripts to get some experience with pandas and, hopefully, some natural language processing with spaCy. This is possible thanks to the efforts of chakoteya.net (which hosts HTML versions of the scripts) and Gary Broughton, who scraped them and put them in a much friendlier JSON format. I wrote a module called ```trekparser``` (available in this repo) to break them down even further into a big DataFrame of lines of dialogue. This DataFrame is also available in this repo, in csv format as ```table_of_lines.csv```.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first in what I hope to be a several-part series of posts, I'll poke around this fairly large dataset, extract some fun facts, and possibly even gain some insights into large-scale properties of the Trek corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two notes on terminology before we start. First, we've got a collision between TV series and pandas Series; the capitalization will distinguish them. Second, since they're going to be used extensively, the abbrevations used for the various series stand for: TOS (The Original Series, 1966-69), TAS (The Animated Series, 1973-74), TNG (The Next Generation, 1987-94), DS9 (Deep Space 9, 1993-99), VOY (Voyager, 1995-2001), and ENT (Enterprise, 2001-05). Of course, you could also get the years from the airdates in the episodes table!"
